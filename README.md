# Blog. README

## Overview
Blog. is a blog application built with React for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, and Go for the backend.

## Components
### Frontend (React)
- The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient.
- Components are organized into a modular structure, promoting code maintainability and scalability.

### Backend (Go)
- The backend of the application is developed with Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for building scalable and efficient software.
- Go's concurrency support and performance make it well-suited for building high-performance backend systems.
- The backend handles HTTP requests from the frontend, interacts with the MongoDB database, and processes data as required.

### Database (MongoDB)
- MongoDB is used as the database for this project, providing a scalable and flexible document-based data model.
- MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with for developers familiar with JavaScript object notation (JSON).
- The database stores blog posts, user information, and any other necessary data for the application.
